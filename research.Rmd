My currently research is focused on the identification of Cercospora spp. involved in Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain on soybean previously known to be caused by a solo species, _C. kikuchii_. Once the species identification is done, I will characterize them for fungicide resistance mainly for QoIs and DMIs. 

I am also investigating the incidence of Brown spot _Septoria glycines_ under different management practices.

I have had also the opportunity to lecture on AGRON 514 [Master Science in Agronomy ISU](https://www.agonline.iastate.edu/courses/course/2022-spring/agron-514-1) & AGRON 533 [Master Science in Agronomy ISU](https://www.agonline.iastate.edu/courses/course/2021-summer/agron-533-1).

Also, part of the job, we are running many plot trials of fungicide efficacy for the main fungal diseases of soybean and maize. I am along with [Dr. Nabin Kumar Dangal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nabin-Dangal-2) responsible of the data collection and analyses of these trials. Also MSc [Stith Wiggs](https://www.plantpath.iastate.edu/people/stith-wiggs) is in charged of all field activities as planting, irrigation system, fungicide sprays, crop management and all related with the plot research and the experimental design. Yet [Anna Schacher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-schacher-b9a4941b7?trk=public_profile_browsemap_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is in charged of all logistics. 

Finally, I am also currently a temporary lab manager. Graduate students and postdocs require highly demanding hourly help to get done many of their projects. The ongoing projects at the lab are root tracker, density population x phenotopy varieties on soybeans, and a new study on Mungbeans in IA, just for mention some examples.

My main Mexican collaborators are  [Dr. Diego Jarquin](https://agronomy.ifas.ufl.edu/people/diego-jarquin/) and [Dr. Juan Manuel Tovar-Pedraza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan-Tovar-Pedraza).

My doctoral research was focus on the study of risk of fungicide resistance emergence in [_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2005.00316.x)
known as white mold, a fungal pathogen that causes disease outbreaks on soybean. Keen, the aims are  to determine fungicide sensitivity of populations from soybean; evaluate the effect of different fungicide applications on the sensitivity of field populations; and characterize the population structure and genetic diversity populations from soybean throughout the North Central United States and Mexico./ Mi  investigación doctoral estuvo enfocada en el estudio del riesgo a la emergencia de la resistencia a fungicidas por [_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2005.00316.x)  conocido como moho blanco, un hongo fitopatógeno que causa enfermedad en soya. Los objetivos son, determinar la sensibilidad a fungicidas de poblaciones de soya; evaluar el efecto de diferentes aplicaciones de fungicidas en la sensibilidad de la poblaciones directamente en el campo; y caracterizar la estructura poblacional y diversidad genética de poblaciones de soya dentro Estados Unidos central y México  

My thesis title was "Fungicide Sensitivity and Population Structure of _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ from Soybean in
the North Central United States and Dry Bean
in Mexico"/ El título de mi tesis fue  "Sensibilidad a fungicidas y estructura poblacional de _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ de soya en Estados Unidos central y de fríjol en México".
